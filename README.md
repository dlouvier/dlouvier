Hello there! ðŸŒŸ

My name is Daniel Louvier, and I'm a versatile SRE / DevOps / Platform Engineer. (Iâ€™ve worn so many hats that you can pick your favorite! ;D)

Recently, Iâ€™ve been focusing on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), but I also have extensive experience with AWS and Azure. I'm a [Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)](https://www.credly.com/badges/4cab5a93-e22d-4286-9208-493f0c3adc5d) and a [Certified Kubernetes Application Developer](https://www.credly.com/badges/cc81248c-ce2f-44d0-a58a-a02e5a7bb944). My expertise extends to Infrastructure as Code with tools like Terraform and Pulumi, and observability platforms such as the Prometheus+Grafana stack and Datadog. Iâ€™m particularly interested in security and cost optimization.

If you've landed on my GitHub profile, chances are you're curious about the projects and code I've been crafting. Hereâ€™s a quick look at what youâ€™ll find:
